                <p>Kicking off the other end of this list is the tiny cove of Stefanou Beach in Crete, Greece. This
                    tranquil little inlet lies about 2km east of the nearest village of Chordaki. The only ways to get
                    to this spot are either by car or by boat. The azure Mediterranean waters and photogenic cliffs have
                    made the beach a bit of a tourist hotspot in recent years, and for good reason. The beach is made up
                    of both pebbles and sand, and is the perfect spot for a nice swim or a brief hike up the cove that
                    surrounds the little beach.</p>

                <p> Ah, beach day. The beach can either be a romantic getaway for you and your special someone, or a
                    great place for a family vacation (or if your name is Michael Scott, the perfect place for a hot dog
                    eating contest and a fire walk). However you spend your day on the beach, chances are you love them,
                    just like everyone else in the world. So for this list, we've decided to look at beaches.

                <p> Whether seeking history, solitude, or a vibrant nightlife, the East Coast has got it all in the
                    unique little towns speckling its pristine shorelines. With some of the best beaches, lively
                    downtowns and natural scenery, one will get the long-craved escape at one of these
                    less-crowded gems.To level up the experience, there is a camping option to set up a tent anchoring right
                    in the sands, no permit requirement for a bonfire, and some food options and a convenience store
                    onsite. For more exploration, there are the salt marshes, 37 miles of beach, as well as hiking,
                    kayaking, paddle-boarding, canoeing, and cruiser biking, with rentable equipment at the Assateague
                    Outfitters.

                </div>
                <P> Perhaps the prettiest beach on this list, Australia’s Ninety Mile Beach is, well... about 90 miles
                    long. Coastal towns run all the way across the beachfront along with a handful of lakes and lagoons.
                    The golden sands have made Ninety Mile Beach a popular tourist destination for camping, picnicking,
                    whale-watching and water sports. Rotamah Island is located right off the beach and contains a major
                    bird observatory. Surf fishing is also a major activity across the beach. If you find yourself
                    around Melbourne anytime soon, Ninety Mile Beach would certainly be worth a visit.</P>

            <p>Ask true beach lovers to name a favorite swath of surf and sand, and the answer changes with the tides.
                Luckily our planet is covered in oceans, seas, and lakes, which means there’s a beach to indulge any
                whim. From pearly crescents covered in shells to turquoise bays teeming with Skittles-colored fish,
                they’re not all created equal. <br> At Beaches, just about anything you could ever imagine is included.
                So
                leave your wallets (and your cares) behind, and get ready for the time of your lives!

                <span>Every Beach Lover Will Relate To:</span>
                <h3>Beach? I think you meant "heaven."</h3>
                <p class="say2">There are some people who take a special liking to being alone in the woods. Others prefer relaxing
                    lakeside, or being in the city at night. But for some of us, we couldn't possibly imagine a more
                    blissful place than the beach. The sand under your toes, the gentle crashing of waves, the salty
                    ocean breeze- few places are as simple and perfect. For us ocean lovers, going to the beach is an
                    unparalleled experience, and there are feelings that go through our minds every time.</p>
                <span>when you dig your toes into the sand, it feels like a touch from the hand of God himself:</span>
                <p class="say2">After walking on solid ground for such a long time, the soft, squishy sand feels like a pillow under
                    your feet. Ahhh.</p>
                <span>Finding seashells feels like discovering treasure:</span>
                <p class="say2">A lot of them look the same, but every once in a while, you'll find that special shell that makes
                    everything feel right in the world. Beautiful and unique, just like life</p>
                <span>You love going on wild, thrilling ocean adventures:</span>
                <p class="say2">Whether it's surfing or sailing, scuba diving or riding helicopters over the shore, you've done lots
                    of exciting, daring things beyond the usual walk on the beach. Which is still amazing, of course.
                </p>
                <span>since you spend a lot of time at the beach, sunburn is no stranger to you:</span>
                <p class="say2">Even if you faithfully apply sunscreen, sometimes sunburn is inevitable. You're used to it, but it's
                    still no fun to deal with burning, flaking skin. Unless you're one of the lucky ones who tans.</p>
                <span>Going home is bittersweet, but it's not goodbye forever:</span>
                <p class="say2">You hate leaving and going back to normal life, but returning to the ocean, no matter how far into
                    the future it will be, always seems to come in the blink of an eye. It really does feel like a
                    second home, and like home, it's always there, waiting for you to return again:</p>

                        life because screens don’t work that great in the sun so they usually stay tucked safely in your
                        bag. A person who can stand to be unplugged from technology for a few hours is a much happier
                        person than most people.</p>
